# Pig Game
Welcome to Pig Game, a classic dice game where the goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points.

## How to Play
- The game is played by two players, taking turns to roll a dice.
- Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice as many times as they wish, adding up the total of the dice rolls.
- However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points accumulated in that turn and their turn ends.
